## MY EXPERIENCE : 
As the project mainly focuses on data wrangling and cleaning process,the skills acquired are really handy and are necessary in analyzing almost any dataset.Getting to know about all the possible data sources and creating a single global dataset out of all the data collected was really helpful.Being clear in the steps that are to be carried out in order to clean the dataset by writing them down under Assessment Summary can really help to stick to the point instead of getting intimidated by humongous data.
